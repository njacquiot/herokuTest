1- sign up to https://signup.heroku.com/ (free)
2- sign up to https://github.com/ (free too)
3- then follow what explained in: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-deploy-a-nodejs-app-to-heroku-from-github-without-installing-heroku-on-your-machine-433bec770efe

3.1 - create a folder myserver1
3.2 - create a file package.json (copy contents from -3-)
3.3 - create a file app.js (copy contents from -3-)
	test your server: 
			npm install 
			npm start
	then visit:
			locahost:3000/

3.4 - create a new github repository 
	call it: myserver1
        an press "create"

3.5 Now: PUSH the node project to github
	open a term in the same folder where the app.js is and type:
		git init
		git add . 
		git remote add origin https://github.com/andrea270872/myserver.git
		git push --set-upstream origin master
	that should do it.
    Check https://github.com/andrea270872/myserver to see if your files are there!

3.6 Now in https://dashboard.heroku.com select "create new app"
	-> name for example: stupid-sever-1 (do not use spaces or _ or special characters)
	Then click on "create"

3.7 Choose deployment method: github, then click "connect to github"
	Github will ask you to confirm that Heroku has access to your github repositories, say yes 
	then insert your github password.
	Then: select which repository you want use: here it should be github.com/andrea270872/myserver
	Finally: select Automatic Deployment, so as soon as the changes are pushed to GitHub, 
		Heroku will pick them up and re-deploy the server

3.8 In Heroku, go to "settings" menu. Add buildpack -> select node.js
3.9 Go back to "deploy" menu, at the bottom, click on "deploy branch" -> DONE!
	Now: click on "view" and it should send you to: https://stupid-sever-1.herokuapp.com/
	where your server is up and running!


4. now change the app.js (so it write a different message on the root page)
   Then: git commit (and remove the # to the lines you want to commit)
   And:  git push
   Wait a few secs and open https://stupid-sever-1.herokuapp.com/ , it should look different! ;)
